#### Favorite Locations: The forests of Ohio & the mountains of New Mexico
The mountains of **New Mexico**, specifically the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Rocky Mountains, as well as the forests near **Kensington, OH** are some of my favorite places in the world because of the memories I made visiting them with my father.
